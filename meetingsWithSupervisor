Sir Mashhood Murtaza:

Zabardast Zabardast! Video and it's audio was absolutely clear and its wonderful that today you have completed, at the basic level, the complete thing and now you are in a position to actually start working on your unique dream FYP integrating IoT, AI as well as Cyber-Security in its best tested form - blockchain.

Title:
Intelligent Efficiency Enhanced Block-Chain Based IoT of Securely Connected Vehicles

Description:
Project will include design, partial Implementation and a two fold Simulation of an IoT network and the dynamics of a Vehicle. The nodes of the IoT network will maintain and securely share Block-Chain based (privacy-ensured) information on the network. The information will come from the sensors monitoring different vehicle-dynamics and shared using MQTT protocol. The information will then be utilized in an AI based mechanism designed to improve the vehicles' efficiency.

Partial implementation includes practical implementation of some nodes of the IoT network using effective (e.g., ESP8266 based) devices with all features including those of a Block-Chain peer and MQTT client implemented on them.

IoT network Simulation will include a reasonable number of Virtual Nodes of the IoT simulated as part of the larger Simulation / Implementation of Block-Chain based (privacy-ensured) secure information sharing using the MQTT protocol on Node-Red. 

The MQTT protocol's Broker (Server) will be actually implemented on the system and displayed as part of the Node-Red Simulation.The physical nodes will also share information using the same Broker and so the information transfer to/from them will also be part of the Node-Red display.

Vehicle Dynamics' Simulation will continuously show the results of the A.I. mechanism in the form of enhanced performance of the vehicle. 
The AI mechanism is designed to optimize the critical parameters of vehicle-dynamics on the basis of the information available from the IoT network.

Ok now you should create a new Repository for collecting data and documentation of your work on your FYP

Here is the first little thing to read (and save as a record)

Soon you will get some research papers to read
