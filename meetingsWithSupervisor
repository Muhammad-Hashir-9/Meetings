Sir Mashhood:

Zabardast Zabardast! Video and it's audio was absolutely clear and its wonderful that today you have completed, at the basic level, the complete thing and now you are in a position to actually start working on your unique dream FYP integrating IoT, AI as well as Cyber-Security in its best tested form - blockchain.

Sir Mashhood:

Title:
Intelligent Efficiency Enhanced Block-Chain Based IoT of Securely Connected Vehicles

Description:
Project will include design, partial Implementation and a two fold Simulation of an IoT network and the dynamics of a Vehicle. The nodes of the IoT network will maintain and securely share Block-Chain based (privacy-ensured) information on the network. The information will come from the sensors monitoring different vehicle-dynamics and shared using MQTT protocol. The information will then be utilized in an AI based mechanism designed to improve the vehicles' efficiency.

Partial implementation includes practical implementation of some nodes of the IoT network using effective (e.g., ESP8266 based) devices with all features including those of a Block-Chain peer and MQTT client implemented on them.

IoT network Simulation will include a reasonable number of Virtual Nodes of the IoT simulated as part of the larger Simulation / Implementation of Block-Chain based (privacy-ensured) secure information sharing using the MQTT protocol on Node-Red. 

The MQTT protocol's Broker (Server) will be actually implemented on the system and displayed as part of the Node-Red Simulation.The physical nodes will also share information using the same Broker and so the information transfer to/from them will also be part of the Node-Red display.

Vehicle Dynamics' Simulation will continuously show the results of the A.I. mechanism in the form of enhanced performance of the vehicle. 
The AI mechanism is designed to optimize the critical parameters of vehicle-dynamics on the basis of the information available from the IoT network.

Ok now you should create a new Repository for collecting data and documentation of your work on your FYP

Here is the first little thing to read (and save as a record)
https://www.extremetech.com/cars/176093-v2v-what-are-vehicle-to-vehicle-communications-and-how-does-it-work

Soon you will get some research papers to read

Zainab:
Yes sir I have read the article.
At starting I was a bit confused between the V2V and the automated vehicles.
But then after reading the whole article it became clear that they are quite different from each other. 

Sir Mashhood:
The next paper I will give you to read will address the last part of these notes 

1st paper to read:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27026-9
It will make a good part of your FYP's first presentation where literature review is one of the most important things to be presented. So you have to read it and present the ideas to me ASAP.

We usually read research papers like this:
First we read the abstract
then Conclusion,
then a few lines of the introduction,
then we focus on all figures and graphs to try n grasp as much information as we can in the shortest amount of time. Then we read the remaining paper.
You can use AI's help in any stage but it is specially useful at the last stage.

Sheryar:
I was completed some tasks 
- FYP documentation repo is ready and i share inviation to all of you 
- Read the paper collect some points 
- Also create a presentation using latex (beamer) as well 
i shortly send both files (code,pdf). and will give you update on the latest paper as well

One more thing I did search for different open source simulator. And Gazebo looks fine to me but creating engine simulation could be hard. 
This tools is mostly using with Robos. 

Hashir:
Sir I have started reading the research paper.

Sir Mashhood:
Make a 10 minutes long meeting in person or on signal' a part of your daily schedules. Share your screens during the meetings, record your voices and the screen of your pc's during the meetings and share that recording with me
