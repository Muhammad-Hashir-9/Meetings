## September 2024

**Sir Mashhood:**

> Zabardast! Zabardast! Your video and audio were crystal clear, and it's wonderful that you've completed the basics and are now ready to work on your unique dream FYP integrating IoT, AI, and cybersecurity with blockchain.

> ### Project Details

> **Title:** Intelligent Efficiency Enhanced Block-Chain Based IoT of Securely Connected Vehicles

> **Description:**

> This project involves designing, partially implementing, and simulating an IoT network and vehicle dynamics.  Here's a breakdown:

> * **Secure Information Sharing:** IoT network nodes will securely share blockchain-based data from sensors monitoring vehicle dynamics using the MQTT protocol.
> * **AI-Driven Efficiency:** This data will fuel an AI mechanism to optimize vehicle efficiency.
> * **Implementation:**  Some IoT nodes will be implemented using devices like ESP8266 with blockchain and MQTT capabilities.
> * **Simulation:**
>    *  The IoT network will be simulated on Node-Red, including virtual nodes and secure information sharing.
>    *  An MQTT broker will be implemented and displayed within the Node-Red simulation.
>    *  Physical nodes will also communicate through this broker, integrating them into the simulation.
> * **Vehicle Dynamics Simulation:** This will showcase the AI's impact on vehicle performance by optimizing key parameters based on IoT network data.

> **Next Steps:**

> 1. **Create a repository:** For storing project data and documentation.
> 2. **Read this article:** [https://www.motortrend.com/features/what-is-v2v-v2x-technology/](https://www.motortrend.com/features/what-is-v2v-v2x-technology/) (and save it for your records).
> 3. **Prepare for research papers:** I'll be sharing those soon.

**Zainab:**

> Yes, sir, I have read the article. At first, I was a bit confused between V2V and automated vehicles, but after reading the whole article, it became clear that they are quite different.

**Sir Mashhood:**

> The next paper addresses this distinction.

> **1st Paper:**

> * **Link:** [https://www.nature.com/](https://www.nature.com/) 
> * **Importance:** Include this in your first FYP presentation (literature review).
> * **Present your understanding ASAP.**

> **How to Read Research Papers:**

> 1. **Abstract**
> 2. **Conclusion**
> 3. **Introduction (briefly)**
> 4. **Figures and Graphs**
> 5. **Full Text** (AI can be helpful here)


**Sheryar:**

> I've completed some tasks:
>
> * Created the FYP documentation repository and shared the invitation.
> * Read the paper and gathered key points.
> * Created a presentation using LaTeX (beamer).
> * Will share files (code, pdf) soon and provide an update on the latest paper.
>
> I also explored open-source simulators. Gazebo seems suitable, but engine simulation might be challenging. It's mainly used for robots.

**Hashir:**

> Sir, I have started reading the research paper.


**Sir Mashhood:**

> * **Daily Meetings:** Schedule 10-minute meetings (in-person or on Signal) to share updates. 
> * **Screen Sharing & Recording:** Share screens during meetings and record them for me.
> * **Next Paper:**  "Blockchain-enabled data security in vehicular networks."


**Group:**

> Meeting done.

**Sir Mashhood:**

> **Video Suggestion:**  Pause the recording after every minute or so to plan the next segment (who speaks, topic, visuals).


**Group:**

> Meeting done.

**Sir Mashhood:**

> **Video Feedback:** Good, but mention the paper section before discussing it.  Explain what you understand and clearly state any points of confusion. Don't get stuck; keep moving.


**Group:**

> Meeting done.

**Sir Mashhood:**

> **Excellent progress!**  Now, follow the paper reading method: abstract, conclusion, figures/tables, then full text.  Also, create a YouTube playlist for these videos and add a short introductory video summarizing the discussion.

**Sir Mashhood:**
> **Paper completed** Ma Shah Allah. There is massive improvement! Keep it up! Now that you have completed the introduction/background part, you should move on to the previously discussed method of studying a paper. Starting from abstract, then reading conclusion, then all figures, tables with their labels and descriptions and then the text of the paper
One more thing: please add these videos to a playlist on youtube and add a less than 1 minute video before the previous videos just to give a big picture of the points you discussed in this video

## October 2024
**Next paper to read:**
> Designing a Real-Time Implementable Optimal Adaptive Cruise Control for Improving Battery Health and Energy Consumption in EVs through V2V Communication.

**Sir Mashhood:**
> Ok great! I will watch it in a while.
> Next u need to think about how u can change your blockchain implementation on node-red and esp to match the blockchain discussed in the last paper you read.

> The thing is that I think now you should split the tasks:
> 1- Modified blockchain implementation. 

> 2- Simulink implementation.

> 3- Understanding of the mathematical and control algorithms presented in the paper and their possible modification to fit them for fuel vehicles.

**Reply:**

> **Sheryar**: Blockchain Implementation 

> **Hashir**: Simulink Implementation 

> **Zainab**: Mathematical Model and Algorithms

**Sir Mashhood:**
[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10032499](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10032499)
> I have found this very useful literature review paper published in 2023. Can anyone of you quickly scan through it to find any reference to any paper that does exactly what we are thinking about doing i.e., "using *CACC to optimize vehicles' fuel efficiency" (Cooperative = V2X communication based)

**Zainab:**
> Sir I have read the abstract of this article. I couldn't access the whole article but in the abstract the author discussed how the vehicles equiped with CACC reduces the fuel consumption as compared to those that don't. 
[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15472450.2020.1720673?scroll=top&needAccess=true](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15472450.2020.1720673?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

**Sir Mashhood:**
> Was this article referenced in the above literature review? At what number?

**Zainab:**
> Yes Sir at number 65

### Question Regarding Presentation

**Sir Mashhood:**
> If you have any questions regarding the project, ask them and lear your thoughts about it.

**Zainab:**
> Sir the few questions I have about the project are because we are majorly done with the software side that part is quite clear but still some questions related to this are:

> • For the hardware part we will just use the sensor and ESP or we will implement it in actual vehicles for the project. Or  we will make a dummy vehicle like a toy or something.

> • if we will  implement this project do the cars of this current time are suitable for this whole system or this can only be built within smart cars or electric vehicles.

> • How the data management will happen as there will be a lot of data shared between vehicles on Blockchain how will it be found out which data is meant for whom?
 How will the memory/ space will be managed?

> • For securing the IoT nodes only the protocols are enough? Because hacking can still happen in these protocols. (Without the Blockchain)

**Sheryar:**
> Our goal is not clear because of the parameters, which is causing confusion. The topic we explained to them (Judges) is something they are not familiar with, so they asked the questions about presentation templates, ideas, implementation sides only.

> Based on the review the presentation and recording of that session i come up with the following question.

> * Which parameters should we be working on, and what are the plans to improve them?
> * Why do other cars need to have a relationship with the previous car for vehicle-to-vehicle communication?
> * Our title starts with Intelligence(AI), but we haven’t discussed anything about that.
> * Other than cruise control, in every scenario, the car is controlled by the driver. How do we justify the system provide benefits, and what are the expected outcomes?

> If we complete the project, how can we make it scalable and decentralized, and will cars have enough storage to store all that information?

> What are our deliverables. Do we only provide them some working sensors and Node red simulation of whole system?

> What are our plans for Phase 2 how can we satisfy them based on our previous interactions


<center><mark>Still we need to update our progress of Nov & Dec. We will update that as soon as possible.</mark></center>
